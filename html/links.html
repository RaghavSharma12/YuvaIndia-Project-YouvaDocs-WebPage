                        A passport is a travel document purchased from a government, primarily for the
                        purpose
                        of allowing its holder to travel internationally. The document certifies the personal identity
                        and
                        nationality of its holder.Standard passports contain the full name, photograph, place and date
                        of
                        birth, signature, and the expiration date of the passport.Many countries issue (or plan to
                        issue)
                        biometric passports that contain an embedded microchip, making them machine-readable and
                        difficult
                        to counterfeit.Many countries normally allow entry to holders of passports of other countries,
                        sometimes requiring a visa also to be obtained, but this is not an automatic right. </p>
